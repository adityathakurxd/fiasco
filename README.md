With quarantine, everthing moved online but **family finances are still isolated and untapped.** The consumption of online media has risen and so has online shopping. An average household spends over thousands of ruppees on shared WiFi bills, Netflix or other media subscription, Music, YouTube premiums, Electricity and Water bills.

 - Pay bills and track expenses.
 - Budget and share resources.
 - Provide pocket money to young members.
 - Manage finances on the go for the whole family.

**Fiasco** is one stop solution to help you manage Family expenses in one place!
